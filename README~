== simpleCRM

Simple CRM as the name suggests is a personal project to help me ramp up with
rails development. I am using cucumber with RSPec to drive out the develepment in a BDD fashion

== BDD

I intend to write cucumber features and step definitions for all the functionality of the site
including pretested plugings/gems because cucumber tests the overall behaviour.
But I am delving into RSPec for them because it seems an overkill. Also, if at all I use 
scaffold code, I am not going to test it with RSPec for the same reason.
